# svm_sim
A Space Vector Modulation (SVM) simulator for FOC analysis  

This simulator can be used to generate the bus current waveform when running a PMSM motor with FOC using SVM. This is usefule for among other things figure out which bus capacitors are needed on a motor controller for different operating conditions.

Here is a video where I use the simulator and explain how everything works

The simple LTspice models are in the ltspice folder, and ltspice can be downloaded from here

LTspice runs perfectly in wine under Linux, which is what I have been doing.
